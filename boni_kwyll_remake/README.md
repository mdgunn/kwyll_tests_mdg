# Boni Kwyll Remake

Partial remake (possibly first level or 2 only) of the game "Boni in Bat Hell" by SteveTyson.

The aim was to compare Kwyll's beta against a MPAGD game to see how Kwyll is performing. Kwyll had not been heavily optimised at this time but it would give a measure of where things were at. 

Boni in Bat Hell (BIBH) was chosen because Steve had mentioned it in the Kwyll discord and it seemed like a nice modern platformer that it would be practical to replicate (at least the first level or 2).

The aim was to reproduce something similar that could be executed back to back with BTBH to make some judgements about if Kwyll was feeling similarly fast enough, or requiring further work or certain techniques to produce a similarly snappy game in this different engine.

Perhaps later we could try to add in some sort of timing mechanimsms but initially I'm interested in the basic feel and any frustrations in collisions, jumps etc while excersising the game.}
