# Boni Kwyll Remake

Building a partial remake (possibly first level or 2 only) of the MAPGD built game "Boni in Bat Hell"(Boni) by SteveTyson that may help to understand how to build a similar platformer in Kwyll. BIBH is available on itch.io allowing easy access to a game we can do some rudimentary comparison of performance and feel of the MAPG version versus Kwyll. Boni available here: https://stevetyson.itch.io/boni. Steve has been consulted on this use of Boni as a learning example.

The aim is not to be an exact replica but instead to examine how to keep Kwyll quick while performing similar basic mechanics in as rudementary a form as is necessary to maintain speed (because Kwyll has not yet undergone significant optimisation). 

ZEsarUX(12.0) running on PC is the usual target for running 'feel' comparisons.
